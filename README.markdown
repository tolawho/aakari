Aakari is a Ghost theme based on Bootstrap 4. The theme's layout is simple and effective. Inspiration was taken from the blog of Digital Ocean. The theme has a transparent navbar followed by a topics bar. When the navbar is scrolled out of the topics bar, it adds a shadow effect. The theme uses very simple layout, and the actual blog posts are wrapped by a custom container. This is actually my second Ghost theme based on Bootstrap 4. **Please send me a link at vasanthdevelopers@gmail.com of your Ghost blog if you are using my theme. That brings smile to me!**
